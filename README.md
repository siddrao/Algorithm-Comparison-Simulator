# Algorithm-Comparison-Simulator

The main aim of this application is to implement an interactive demo/simulator which will help students understand key networking concepts. The simulator we developed will allow
students to get a visual representation of how routing algorithms work. In this application, we have chosen Dijkstra’s algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm and developed a suitable simulator for them. The simulator allows students to easily play around with different inputs scenarios and possibilities by generating corresponding graphs. Hence, letting users understand, analyze and make comparison between the two algorithms.

Steps to run the application:
1. Download and install the Netbeans IDE
2. Download the Java jdk and set the environment variable
3. Request and download the JxBrowser license jar
4. Import source files into Netbeans
5. Correct the paths to the libraries present in the "newlib" folder
6. Running the project will display the application.
