            <p>The purpose of routing algorithms is to find a path has the least cost in a network of nodes that are linked to
each other. Routing algorithms are broadly classified into two types namely global and decentralized. The
algorithm that finds the least cost path while having global state information is also known as Link State algorithms
while the Distance Vector algorithm is a decentralized algorithm that finds the least cost path iteratively without
 having the global information at the start.</p>

        <h3 >Link State Routing</h3>
        <p>The basic idea behind Link State routing is very simple wherein it consists of two phases. Initially in the first phase
starts with each node knowing the cost to its neighbors and ends with each node knowing the entire network.
Then in the second phase, with the use of the algorithm, each node calculates the optimal least cost path as every
other node. The Link State routing algorithm that the users will learn in this simulator is the Dijkstra’s Algorithm.</p>

<h4>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h4>
If there are n nodes in the network, Dijkstra’s algorithm will calculate the least cost paths to the n nodes by the nth
iteration. A major disadvantage of the algorithm is the fact that it does a blind search thereby consuming a lot of
time. Also, it cannot handle negative edges which lead to acyclic graphs and if negative edges are present it most
often cannot obtain the right shortest path.</p>

        <h3>Distance Vector Routing</h3>
        <p>
            Distance Vector Routing is a routing protocol used in packet-switched networks. It is used to measure the distance
between nodes so that the best path for packet transmission can be determined. Distance is usually measured in
terms of hops, where each router counts as a single hop. In this, each router maintains a routing table which
consists of a number of hops to every other node in the network. It is also required that each router informs its
neighbors periodically, about the topological changes in the network.</p>

           The differences in the algorithms can be seen based on the parameters like: Message
            Complexity, Robustness, Speed of convergence
            <ul>
                <li><b>Message Complexity</b> – Message complexity denotes the maximum number of messages transmitted over any
            edge. Initially, nodes send messages to each other and get to know the cost to reach the nodes. If the cost of an
            edge between two nodes changes, the new edge cost has to be sent to all nodes. Dijkstra’s algorithm being a
            global routing algorithm informs the change to all the nodes . As the Bellman Ford algorithm only exchanges
            messages between directly connected neighbors, communicating the change in cost requires transmission of a lot
            more messages than Dijkstra’s algorithm. </li>
            
            
                <li><b>Speed of Convergence</b> – Speed of convergence of an algorithm simply means the time required to find the shortest
            path from a source node to destination. As Dijkstra’s can calculate the least cost path in n iterations, its speed of
            convergence is more, meaning it will take less time to calculate the path. In Bellman Ford nodes will take a lot of
            time to inform each other about the costs and hence this algorithm converges slowly. Speed of convergence of
            the algorithms can be seen with continuously updating the cost to reach each node which will be shown in a table.
           </li>
            
            
                <li><b>Robustness</b> – Simulating robustness of algorithms is nothing but showing how they will adapt in case of a node
                failure. </li>
            </ul>
